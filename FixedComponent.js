The solution depends on the specific library causing the error.  Generally, you need to:

1. **Verify Library Installation:** Double-check that the library is installed correctly using `npm ls <libraryName>` or `yarn why <libraryName>`. 
2. **Link Native Modules (if applicable):**  Many native modules require linking. Consult the library's documentation for specific instructions.  This often involves running commands like `react-native link`.
3. **Check Android/iOS project settings:** Ensure that the native Android (Android/app/build.gradle) and iOS (ios/<YourAppName>.xcodeproj) project files are properly configured to include the library's native code. 
4. **Clean and rebuild:**  After making any changes, clean and rebuild your project. For Android, you might need to run `./gradlew clean` followed by a rebuild. For iOS, use Xcode's clean build functionality.
5. **Update dependencies:** Make sure all of your dependencies (especially React Native itself) are up to date. 

Example (if the problem was missing linking):

```javascript
// BuggyComponent.js (Illustrates the problem)
import React from 'react';
import { requireNativeComponent } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = requireNativeComponent('MyComponent'); // Error occurs here

export default function BuggyComponent() {
  return <MyComponent/>;
}

// FixedComponent.js (Corrected version, assuming proper linking)
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from 'react-native-my-component'; //Import after linking

export default function FixedComponent() {
  return <MyComponent/>;
}
```
