This repository demonstrates a common React Native error, an Invariant Violation related to requireNativeComponent.  The error arises when a native component isn't found, frequently stemming from problems integrating third-party libraries. The `BuggyComponent.js` file showcases the problematic code, highlighting the missing native component linkage.  The solution, demonstrated in `FixedComponent.js`, addresses the issue by ensuring correct library installation, linking, and configuration.
